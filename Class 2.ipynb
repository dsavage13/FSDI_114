Another key difference is reference points, in a stack you just need to reference the top, while in a queue you need to reference both front and rear. Some examples are like the email inbox vs outbox. When you have your inbox, the last message to be recieved is the first one to be displayed. But in the outbox, (or sent box) the first message in gets sent first. \n",
